				<p>The following will be compared to the great bodies of work, from poets like John Keats and Scientist <br>
					 as great as Marie Curie. Also the writer of this webpage may have massive delusions of grandeur. Seriously <br>
					 though this page will be used to keep track of each session’s tasks to help me verify I have achieved the goals <br>

				<h3>A self learning session if you will</h3>
				<p>This was done before class started and I followed <a href="https://youtu.be/USjZcfj8yxE" target="_blank">this youtube video</a> <br>
					 on how to set up HTML and then add a CSS and Java ideas. It also helped cover git and github which was very helpful.</p>
				<p>It was fun to do a short exercise like this and see how everything interacted. It made me realize that I wish I had followed <br>
					 through with my intentions on starting to try this a long time ago.</p>

					<h2>Lesson 01 Assignment</h2>

				<h3>"...there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton"</h3>
				<p>This was done in conjuction with learning about Semantic Elements. I found it a fun little practice where <br>
					 I tried to incorporate as much as I could in order to break something and try to learn how to fix it. I got to <br>
					 understand how Semantic Elements help structure the webpage and why they are so important</p>
