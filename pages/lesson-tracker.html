Also the writer of this webpage may have massive delusions of grandeur. Seriously though this page will be used to keep track of each session’s tasks to help me verify I have achieved the goals of the assignment.</p>

				<p>It was fun to do a short exercise like this and see how everything interacted. It made me realize that I wish I had followed through with my intentions on starting to try this a long time ago.</p>
